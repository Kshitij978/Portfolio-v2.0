    firstPara: `Hey there! I graduated in Computer Science and transitioned into a role as a Frontend Developer. I started with HTML/CSS and jumped  into  JavaScript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, and NextJS.
  Now, I'm diving into cool stuff like WebGL, Shaders, and ThreeJS for interactive web magic.`,
    secondPara: `When I'm not coding, catch me having a blast with Blender, Figma, and Spline, playing  video games or sketching.
  Also, I'm a bit of a space nerd - love reading about astrophysics and always up for deep space chats. Let's create awesome things together!`,
